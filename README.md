# Spectral-Clustering-

This repo is a collection of test cases for the CPQR clustering. We assess the performance of CPQR with the criteria of RatioCut and NCut.
We build the similarity matrix based on the statistical model explained in the paper where we know the "true" clusters. We built test cases
when there are 2 and more than 2 clusters, when the clusters are equal-sized and unequal-sized.
